<h1> Giftastic HW for my UW Full Stack Dev Bootcamp </h1>
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<p>This webpage was made for the user to interact with gifs and searching for gifs of their own interest. I decided to do my "GifTastic" page NFL themed which involved 9 popular "gif esque" NFL players. I also added the commissioner Roger Goodell because he would have a lot of fun gifs attached to his name. You can click on any of them, and it will populate a total of 10 of the top gifs, and also give you the parental rating for each one.</p>
